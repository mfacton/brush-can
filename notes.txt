maybe not solder power pins because they stick out the back(also not short)
also put the programmer on top to not short
don't use small or plugged vias
add enable signal
remove reset and boot extras

pwm frequency for ina, inb, current limiter 50khz

based on simulation takes about 20ms to do 1.5V swing of current limit input

current limit(A) = Vref * (1000/2200Î©) or Vref * 0.454545
limit(A) = Duty% * 3/200
limit(A) = Duty(1-100) * 0.015
